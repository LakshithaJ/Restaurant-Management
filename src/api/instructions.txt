I have created the users in db.json using postman
Steps:
0. Create a db.json file and run the command: json-server --watch db.json in its location
1. Create an empty Users object in db.json file
2. Go to postman and Ctrl+T, change the method to POST, paste "http://localhost:3000/users" in the URL, click on body, select RAW format and create the object as below and hit send
{
    "name": "john",
    "email": "john@test.com",
    "password":"john@123"
}
New user will be added to the Users array in db.json
